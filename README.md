# Caffe Retro Website

## Description
You are contacted by the advertising agency SkissaMera, who has produced a sketch of a website for a client – a cafe called Caffe Retro.

## Sketch
The sketch is in the form of a video, "Caffe Retro sketch," and it shows a website consisting of a web page divided into three sections (Hot, Juicy, and Cosy). Watch carefully, pausing to see details as you work.

You must imitate the sketch as closely as possible. Do not use your own images and fonts, but use the attached material, follow the look in the video, and the instructions in this exercise description. The built-in CSS color `darkred` is a good color for this exercise.

The different images, fonts, texts, and video are available in the `assets` folder.

## Instructions
1. The website must have three sections.
2. Every section should fill an entire window.
3. Every section should have a header, texts, and background images according to the sketch.
4. There must be a menu with links to the different sections.
5. Every background image should cover its entire section.
6. The website should have as many semantic elements as possible.
7. The menu should be fixed to the top of the window at all times.
